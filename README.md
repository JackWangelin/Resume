- Stepping into an immersive course for user experience design at General Assembly provided me with the tools and processes necessary to become a pensive and logic-driven user experience architect.
- Mastered user flow diagramming
- Designed a concept validation platform and created its deployment strategy. Client plans to build and deploy by end of fourth quarter 2015.
- Redesigned the guest experience for a hotel chain* targeting millennial business travelers. Started by eliminating the major pain point of check-in/out
- Collaborated with front-end developers to create a deployable MVP in an experimental cross-immersive program project
* Designed an online checkout flow to allow user to review purchase, set billing and shipping address, pay, and create an account in two steps
* Designed a faceted navigation schema for a K-12 school uniform company’s* e-commerce site that shows gender as the primary tier of taxonomy is not a necessity.
